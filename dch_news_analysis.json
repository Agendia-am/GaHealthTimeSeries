As a result, some members received termination notices or saw their coverage end in error. Cases that were incorrectly terminated will be reinstated as quickly as possible. The Department of Community Health is taking the following steps to address the issue: All affected cases are being reviewed. The vast majority of eligible cases have already been reinstated. However, we continue to review the affected files to be certain all eligible members have been reinstated. Coverage for reinstated members will be restored retroactively to ensure there are no gaps in services or billing. Providers will be notified that this was a system error, and not a lapse in eligibility. We are asking providers to not cancel or move appointments. This error was not caused by any action taken by our members and does not reflect a change in the member\u2019s eligibility. Medicaid and Peachcare for Kids\u00ae members do not need to submit a new application or take any additional steps at this time. If coverage was incorrectly terminated, it will be reinstated automatically. Any services received during the affected period will continue to be covered. We sincerely apologize for the stress and inconvenience this issue may have caused. Medicaid and Peachcare for Kids\u00ae members rely on consistent access to care, and we take that responsibility seriously. Members who have questions about this incident can contact Gainwell Technologies at 1-866-211-0950, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. E.T.

As a result, some members received termination notices or saw their coverage end in error. This was not due to any action on a member or parent\u2019s part, and it does not reflect a change in the member\u2019s eligibility. What we have done to fix it All affected cases are being reviewed and reinstated as quickly as possible. Coverage for impacted members will be restored retroactively to ensure there are no gaps in services or billing. Providers will be notified that this was a system error, not a lapse in eligibility. We are asking providers to not cancel or move appointments. What this means for Katie Beckett families No new application or additional steps need to be taken at this time. If your child was affected, their Medicaid coverage under the Katie Beckett program will be reinstated automatically. Any services your child received during the affected period will continue to be covered. If you received a termination notice, please disregard it. We sincerely apologize for the stress and inconvenience this may have caused to the families in Katie Beckett. Families in the Katie Beckett program rely on consistent access to care, and we take that responsibility seriously.

Key Updates Effective October 1: Parents and legal guardians of children under six and enrolled in Medicaid will now be considered an additional qualifying activity, in addition to the previously approved qualifying activities of working, volunteering, and educational pursuits. Members will now only be required to report qualifying activities and hours at application and at annual renewal to continue their coverage. This will align with reporting requirements of other Medicaid enrollment categories in Georgia and reduce administrative burdens on both beneficiaries and the state. A retroactive coverage policy will be established for the Pathways to Coverage program, meaning coverage will now begin on the first day of the month in which an application is received. Pathways members will be required to pay a copayment for certain services. Copayment amounts vary based upon the service. If you cannot pay the copayment, you may still receive services. Copayments are not required for Pathways members under age 21. For more information about Pathways, visit pathways.georgia.gov . To apply, visit gateway.ga.gov . Applicants may also apply by phone at 1-877-423-4746 or 711 for those who are deaf, hard of hearing, deaf-blind, or have difficulty speaking; in-person at your local Division of Family & Children Services (DFCS) office: dfcs.ga.gov\/locations ; or by mail to your local DFCS office.

This move will go a long way to support uninsured Georgians in affected zip codes by replacing prescription medicines and certain medical equipment lost or damaged due to the impacts of Hurricane Helene. Uninsured Georgians may request a free 30-day supply of certain prescription medications at any EPAP-participating pharmacy which can be renewed every 30 days while the EPAP is active. The program also pays for replacements of some types of durable medical equipment and supplies such as canes; crutches; walkers; wheelchairs; blood sugar meters; and blood sugar test strips for diabetics. Vaccinations provided by retail pharmacies also may be covered under EPAP. To read more about the EPAP, click here .

(Maximus) is providing notice of an incident that involved certain individuals' information. Maximus was formerly a contractor to the Agency to support certain government programs. Information affected in this incident was shared with Maximus for administrative purposes. The incident involved a critical vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer, a third-party software application provided by Progress Software Corporation (Progress). Maximus is among the many organizations in the United States and globally that have been impacted by the MOVEit vulnerability. On May 30, 2023, Maximus detected unusual activity in its MOVEit environment; Maximus promptly began to investigate with the help of nationally recognized cybersecurity experts. Early in the day on May 31, 2023, Maximus took its MOVEit application offline. Later that same day, Progress first publicly announced a previously unknown vulnerability in its MOVEit software, which an unauthorized party used to gain access to files of many MOVEit customers. Maximus subsequently applied vendor recommended actions, including applying new patches made available by Progress, to address the vulnerability. Maxims engaged a forensic investigation firm and a data analysis firm to identify affected individuals and the types of information involved. Maximus learned that on approximately May 27 - 31, 2023, the unauthorized party obtained copies of certain files that were saved in the Maximus MOVEit application. After learning about the files, Maximus began to analyze the files to determine which data was affected. On August 17, 2023, Maximus notified the Agency that our investigation determined that the files contained some personal information. The information involved varied by individual and may include name, address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, Social Security number, medical record number, case number, medical history, condition, treatment, or diagnosis, health insurance information, and claims information. Maximus is offering two years of complimentary access to Experian IdentityWorks. Although the investigation has determined that the incident did not impact our systems directly, beyond our MOVEit application, we continue to enhance our cybersecurity program to safeguard from cyber threats. We also notified and are cooperating with law enforcement. As good practice, it is recommended that individuals regularly monitor account statements and monitor free credit reports. If individuals identify suspicious activity, it is recommended that they contact the company that maintains the account. Maximus takes the privacy and security of personal information very seriously and regrets that this incident occurred. Individuals with questions or concerns should contact Maximus at 833-919-4749 toll-free Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. - 10 p.m. Central, or Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. - 7 p.m. Central (excluding major U.S. holidays) and, if they received a notification letter in the mail, they should be prepared to provide the engagement number provided in that letter. Individuals may also contact Maximus by mail at: 1600 Tysons Blvd., Suite 1400, McLean, VA 22102. To see CareSource 's notice on complimentary credit monitoring services for its members, click here .

Across the nation, states are redetermining the eligibility of every person on their Medicaid rolls through this federally mandated process initiated by the Biden administration on April 1, 2023. Already, Georgia has used waivers to auto-renew coverage for over 115,000 Georgians, counting people who were renewed early and not included in the state's monthly report submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. These include children, pregnant women, low-income families, individuals with disabilities, and senior citizens.

The Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH) announced the renewal of two state directed payment programs, the Physician Directed Payment Program (PDPP) and Hospital Directed Payment Program (HDPP) for public hospitals. SFY23 is the third program year for PDPP and the second for HDPP. Both programs are associated with DCH\u2019s goal of smarter spending through reduced hospitalization and emergency room utilization rates. These efforts are specifically aligned with DCH\u2019s Quality Strategy and will be reviewed and evaluated annually. \u201cOur goal is to improve both access and quality while working to address health disparities related to chronic conditions, preventive care, and women\u2019s and children\u2019s health for underserved populations,\u201d said DCH Commissioner Caylee Noggle. \u201cThe renewal of these programs is part of our overall strategy of using direct payment programs to enhance access to care and to support payment rates for our providers and partners.\u201d Georgia\u2019s PDPP provides state directed payments to eligible physicians and other professional services practitioners who are affiliated with a government teaching hospital. In SFY23, eligible participants are expected to receive approximately $120.6 million in additional funds through rate increases up to the commercial equivalent. Georgia\u2019s HDPP provides additional Medicaid funding for eligible participating public hospitals. Public hospitals are defined as all state and non-state government hospitals, excluding Critical Access Hospitals. In SFY23, eligible participants are projected to receive approximately $236.2 million in additional funding through rate increases up to the Medicare equivalent. This program aims to increase provider funding of critical services for the Medicaid population and strengthen Georgia\u2019s healthcare workforce. State directed payment programs are submitted for annual approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. DCH has similar directed payment programs pending with CMS aimed at benefitting teaching hospitals and private hospitals. If approved, the directed payment programs would collectively result in more than $800 million new federal dollars in SFY23 being directed to hospitals around the state to improve access to care, health outcomes and equity, and the healthcare workforce.
