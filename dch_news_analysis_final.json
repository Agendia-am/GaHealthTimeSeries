As a result, some members received termination notices or saw their coverage end in error. Cases that were incorrectly terminated will be reinstated as quickly as possible. The Department of Community Health is taking the following steps to address the issue: All affected cases are being reviewed. The vast majority of eligible cases have already been reinstated. However, we continue to review the affected files to be certain all eligible members have been reinstated. Coverage for reinstated members will be restored retroactively to ensure there are no gaps in services or billing. Providers will be notified that this was a system error, and not a lapse in eligibility. We are asking providers to not cancel or move appointments. This error was not caused by any action taken by our members and does not reflect a change in the member\u2019s eligibility. Medicaid and Peachcare for Kids\u00ae members do not need to submit a new application or take any additional steps at this time. If coverage was incorrectly terminated, it will be reinstated automatically. Any services received during the affected period will continue to be covered. We sincerely apologize for the stress and inconvenience this issue may have caused. Medicaid and Peachcare for Kids\u00ae members rely on consistent access to care, and we take that responsibility seriously. Members who have questions about this incident can contact Gainwell Technologies at 1-866-211-0950, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. E.T.

As a result, some members received termination notices or saw their coverage end in error. This was not due to any action on a member or parent\u2019s part, and it does not reflect a change in the member\u2019s eligibility. What we have done to fix it All affected cases are being reviewed and reinstated as quickly as possible. Coverage for impacted members will be restored retroactively to ensure there are no gaps in services or billing. Providers will be notified that this was a system error, not a lapse in eligibility. We are asking providers to not cancel or move appointments. What this means for Katie Beckett families No new application or additional steps need to be taken at this time. If your child was affected, their Medicaid coverage under the Katie Beckett program will be reinstated automatically. Any services your child received during the affected period will continue to be covered. If you received a termination notice, please disregard it. We sincerely apologize for the stress and inconvenience this may have caused to the families in Katie Beckett. Families in the Katie Beckett program rely on consistent access to care, and we take that responsibility seriously.

Key Updates Effective October 1: Parents and legal guardians of children under six and enrolled in Medicaid will now be considered an additional qualifying activity, in addition to the previously approved qualifying activities of working, volunteering, and educational pursuits. Members will now only be required to report qualifying activities and hours at application and at annual renewal to continue their coverage. This will align with reporting requirements of other Medicaid enrollment categories in Georgia and reduce administrative burdens on both beneficiaries and the state. A retroactive coverage policy will be established for the Pathways to Coverage program, meaning coverage will now begin on the first day of the month in which an application is received. Pathways members will be required to pay a copayment for certain services. Copayment amounts vary based upon the service. If you cannot pay the copayment, you may still receive services. Copayments are not required for Pathways members under age 21. For more information about Pathways, visit pathways.georgia.gov . To apply, visit gateway.ga.gov . Applicants may also apply by phone at 1-877-423-4746 or 711 for those who are deaf, hard of hearing, deaf-blind, or have difficulty speaking; in-person at your local Division of Family & Children Services (DFCS) office: dfcs.ga.gov\/locations ; or by mail to your local DFCS office.
